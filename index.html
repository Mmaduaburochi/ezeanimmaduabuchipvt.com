An investment is an asset that will eventually provide value that exceeds the initial cost. The term investment can apply to almost any asset, including intangible assets such as Real estate, Liquidity and Agricultural. In terms of the stock market, investing typically refers to the purchase of stocks or bonds. These securities are designed to provide an investor with future value that will exceed their initial cost. Investments can also be made in other assets. Investing in real estate, for example, could mean buying an inexpensive property, renovating to increase its value, and then selling or leasing for more than the original cost.</p>
